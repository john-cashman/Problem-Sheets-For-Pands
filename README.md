# pand-problem-sheet
This repository contains the weekly Problem sheets and weekly tasks for PANDS 2021.


The weekly tasks can be found under the Weekly-Tasks directory.


Week 1 Task:
The task this week was to copy the link to the repository. I figured this out by watching the lecture multiple times and following the lab. I didn't use any external sources this week.


Week 2 Task: bmi.py
The task this week was to create a simple program that calculates a user's BMI. It was difficult to find a simple solution online because most pages like stackexchange had more complex calculators. I mostly got the solution from watching the lecture and then from watching a youtube video and reading a blog as a suplemental. These sources have been included in comments in the code.

Week 3 Task: secondString.py
The task this week was to write a program that asked the user to input a string and then output every second letter in the string in reverse.
Getting an external solution for this program was a little more difficult because most stack exchange solutions used functions which we had not covered yet. So I got most of the solution from following the lecture, W3schools as well as trial and error. The example given on w3schools was return x[::-1] which slices the string and moves backwards from the end of the string. By putting x[::-2] into the program we still start at the end put work back in 2s.

Week 4 Task: 
This week the task was the write a program that asks the user to input a positive integer. The program then divides the number by 2 is it is even or multiplies it by 3 and adds 1 if it is odd.
I didn't know how to complete the task during week 4 despite trying multiple attempts with if else statements. Once we moved on to functions I went back to the task and used the lecture video, a tutorial from w3schools and a website called python central to figure out the answer. 

Week 5 Task: 
This week the task was to write a program that tells the user whether or not the day of the week is a weekend or a weekday.
There was plenty of information online on how to do this. I found a few suggestions from stackoverflow and reference it in the code.
To run the program I needed to import datetime. From there I got today's date from datetime.datetime.today().weekday(). The days of the week run from 0-6 with 5 and 6 being Saturday and Sunday. Knowing this I ran an if else statement to print a message according to whether the day was a weekday or a weekend.

Week 6 Task:
